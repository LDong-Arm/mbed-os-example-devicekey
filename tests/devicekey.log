--- Mbed OS DeviceKey example ---

--- Using the following salt for key derivation: SALT1 ----- SALT1 ------ SALT1 ---
--- First call to derive key, requesting derived key of 16 byte ---
--- Derived key1 is:
[0-9A-F]+

--- Second call to derive key with the same salt. ---
--- Derived key2 should be equal to key1 from the first call. key2 is:
[0-9A-F]+
--- Keys match ---

--- Using the following salt for key derivation SALT2 ----- SALT2 ------ SALT2 ---
--- Third call to derive key with the different salt should result with a new derived key1:
[0-9A-F]+
--- Keys not match ---

--- 32 byte key derivation example. ---
--- 32 byte derived key is:
[0-9A-F]+

--- Mbed OS DeviceKey example done. ---
